    <h2>Gerry Fourman Grills History:</h2>
    <img src="Images/history.jpg" alt="The last recorded photo of Garry.">
    <p>In the picture above you can see our companies founder, Mr. Gerry Fourman. Founded in the year 1994 by Mr. Gerry, the company saw success early on due to the similarities with our name. However, as we became more and more popular for our high quality products we started to make a name for ourselves. Now in 2022 we have grown almost five times our original size. We hope we can continue to bring a relaxing atmosphere to the grill market.</p>
